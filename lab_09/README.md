1. In the **Data** pane, select the **Salesperson (Performance)** table.

1. Review the data, noticing that Michael Blythe (EmployeeKey 281) has a UPN value of: **`michael-blythe@adventureworks.com`**

> *You may recall that Michael Blythe is assigned to three sales regions: US Northeast, US Central, and US Southeast.*

1. On the **Home** ribbon tab, from inside the **Security** group, select **Manage Roles**.

1. In the DAX editor box, enter the following expression:

    ```DAX
    [UPN] = USERPRINCIPALNAME()
    ```

    > *USERPRINCIPALNAME() is a Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) function that returns the name of the authenticated user. It means that the **Salesperson (Performance)** table will filter by the User Principal Name (UPN) of the user querying the model.*

1. Select **Save** and **Close**.

1. To test the security role, on the **Home** ribbon tab, from inside the **Security** group, select **View As**.

   ![Picture 5708](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image27.png)

1. In the **View as Roles** window, check the **Other User** item, and then in the corresponding box, enter: **`michael-blythe@adventureworks.com`**

1. Check the **Salespeople** role, and then **OK**.

> *This configuration results in using the **Salespeople** role and impersonating the user with your Michael Blythe’s name.*

   ![Picture 16](Linked_image_Files/04-configure-data-model-in-power-bi-desktop-advanced_image33.png)

*Note: When the Power BI Desktop file is published to the Power BI service, you’ll need to complete a post-publication task to map security principals to the **Salespeople** role. You won’t do that in this lab.*
