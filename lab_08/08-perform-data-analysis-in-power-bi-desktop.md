# Perform Data Analysis in Power BI

## Lab story

In this lab, you'll create the **Sales Exploration** report.

In this lab you learn how to:

- Create animated scatter charts
- Use a visual to forecast values

**This lab should take approximately 30 minutes.**

## Get started

To complete this exercise, first open a web browser and enter the following URL to download the zip folder:

`https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/PL-300-Microsoft-Power-BI-Data-Analyst/raw/Main/Allfiles/Labs/08-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop/08-perform-analysis.zip`

Extract the folder to the **C:\Users\Student\Downloads\08-perform-analysis** folder.

1. Open the **08-Starter-Sales Analysis.pbix** file.

## Create an animated scatter chart

In this task, you'll create a scatter chart that can be animated.

1. Create a new page and name it **Scatter Chart**.

1. Add a **Scatter Chart** visual to the report page, and then position and resize it so it fills the entire page.

	> *The chart can be animated when a field is added to the **Play Axis** well/area.*

1. Add the following fields to the visual wells/areas:

	> *The labs use a shorthand notation to reference a field. It will look like this: **Reseller** **\|** **Business Type**. In this example, **Reseller** is the table name and **Business Type** is the field name.*

	 - X Axis: **Sales \| Sales**
	 - Y Axis: **Sales \| Profit Margin**
	 - Legend: **Reseller \| Business Type**
	 - Size: **Sales \| Quantity**
	 - Play Axis: **Date \| Quarter**

1. In the **Filters** pane, add the **Product \| Category** field to the **Filters On This Page** well/area.

1. In the filter card, filter by **Bikes**.

1. To animate the chart, at the bottom left corner, select **Play**.

1. Watch the entire animation cycle from **FY2018 Q1** to **FY2020 Q4**.

	> *The scatter chart allows understanding the measure values simultaneously: in this case, order quantity, sales revenue, and profit margin.*
    > 
	> *Each bubble represents a reseller business type. Changes in the bubble size reflect increased or decreased order quantities. While horizontal movements represent increases/decreases in sales revenue, and vertical movements represent increases/decreases in profitability.*

1. When the animation stops, select one of the bubbles to reveal its tracking over time.

1. Hover the cursor over any bubble to reveal a tooltip describing the measure values for the reseller type at that point in time.

1. In the **Filters** pane, filter by **Clothing** only, and notice that it produces a very different result.

1. Save the Power BI Desktop file.

## Create a forecast

In this task, you'll create a forecast to determine possible future sales revenue.

1. Add a new page, and then rename the page to **Forecast**.

1. Add a **Line Chart** visual to the report page, and then position and resize it so it fills the entire page.

	 ![Picture 74](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image22.png)

1. Add the following fields to the visual wells/areas:

	 - X-axis: **Date \| Date**
	 - Y-axis: **Sales \| Sales**

1. In the **Filters** pane, add the **Date \| Year** field to the **Filters On This Page** well/area.

1. In the filter card, filter by two years: **FY2019** and **FY2020**.

	> *When forecasting over a time line, you'll need at least two cycles (years) of data to produce an accurate and stable forecast.*

1. Add also the **Product \| Category** field to the **Filters On This Page** well/area, and filter by **Bikes**.

1. To add a forecast, beneath the **Visualizations** pane, select the **Analytics** pane.

	 ![Picture 20](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image26.png)

1. Expand the **Forecast** section.

	> *If the **Forecast** section isn't available, it’s probably because the visual hasn’t been correctly configured. Forecasting is only available when two conditions are met: the axis has a single field of type date, and there’s only one value field.*

1. Turn the **Forecast** option to **On**.

1. Configure the following forecast properties, then **Apply**:

	- Units: **Months**
	- Forecast length: **1 month**
	- Seasonality: **365**
	- Confidence interval: **80%**

	![Picture 52](Linked_image_Files/10-perform-data-analysis-in-power-bi-desktop_image29.png)

1. In the line visual, notice that the forecast has extended one month beyond the history data.

	> *The gray area represents the confidence. The wider the confidence, the less stable—and therefore the less accurate—the forecast is likely to be.*
    >
	> *When you know the length of the cycle, in this case annual, you should enter the seasonality points. Sometimes it could be weekly (7), or monthly (30).*

1. In the **Filters** pane, filter by **Clothing** only, and notice that it produces a different result.
